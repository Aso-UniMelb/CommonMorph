  <h1>CommonMorph Project</h1>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>We aim to build the world's most diverse and comprehensive collection of morphological data by connecting linguists
    and native speakers across the globe. By crowdsourcing contributions from a wide community, we are creating a
    resource
    that reflects the rich variation and complexity of the world's languages—especially those that are under-documented
    or
    endangered.</p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>Participants contribute by submitting inflect word forms and other morphological structures from their own
    languages or areas of research.
    The platform is designed to support a wide range of languages and varieties, allowing users to input structured
    information. Submissions are reviewed collaboratively. The verified datasets are automatically prepared for
    download.</p>

  <h2>Who Can Participate</h2>
  <p>Our project welcomes contributions from linguists, field researchers, language enthusiasts, and speakers of any
    language variety. Whether you're a professor documenting case marking in a minority language or a community member
    sharing the verbal morphology of your native dialect, your input is invaluable. No formal training is required—just
    familiarity with your language and a willingness to contribute.</p>

  <h2>Why Morphology?</h2>
  <p>Morphology—how words are formed and change—is key to understanding the structure and function of any language. Yet,
    it is often underrepresented in large-scale linguistic databases. By focusing on morphological data, we are filling
    a
    crucial gap in language documentation and making this information accessible for typologists, computational
    linguists,
    language revitalization efforts, and more.</p>

  <h2>A Global Collaboration</h2>
  <p>Languages do not exist in isolation, and neither should linguistic data. Our project is built on the principle of
    collaboration across borders, disciplines, and perspectives. By bringing together a global community, we aim to
    create
    a living, growing database that benefits researchers, educators, and language communities alike.</p>
